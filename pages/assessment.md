## Assessment

The Carpentries value a culture of assessment, and we are consistently evaluating 
our workshops to understand the impact workshops have on our learners, and how we can improve our content delivery.

Dr. Kari L. Jordan, our Director of Assessment and Community Equity, leads our [assessment efforts](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/assessment/assessment.html). She has established the [Assessment Network](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/assessment/assessment-network.html), a space where those working on assessment within the open source/research computing community can collaborate and share resources.
