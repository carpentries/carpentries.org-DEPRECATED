## Equity and Inclusion

We are currently building a <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/equity-and-inclusion">bank of resources</a> that we apply
in our own work and that we are sharing for 
our community to use and add to.

Please be aware of the 
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries/equity-and-inclusion/blob/master/operational-definitions.md">operational definitions</a>
of the terms we use in this repository of materials.
