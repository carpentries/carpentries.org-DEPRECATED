## Instructor Training


To teach Carpentries workshops, people need to certify as Instructors. Once you certify, you can 
  teach any Carpentries workshop.
  
 There are two steps to becoming an instructor.

1. Take the [instructor training course](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).

> This course runs over two full days and covers the basics of
      educational psychology, instructional design, and how to apply both
      to teaching Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops.

2.  Complete the Software Carpentry checkout process

> After the training course, you must complete [three short tasks](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/)
        complete your certification.

### Access to Instructor Training

Most of our Instructors are trained through organizational agreements
    with affiliated institutions. If you have been asked to provide
    information associated with this type of training,
    please fill in [this form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/request_training/). You may have been given a code
    to identify you with the group you are joining. If so, please include that code in your application.

Even if you are not part of an affiliated institution, please use [this form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/request_training/) to
    indicate your interest in training as an Instructor.

### Keeping Your Personal Information Up to Date

  changed your email address, or are now able to teach different lessons,
