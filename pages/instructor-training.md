<h2>Instructor Training</h2>

<p>
To teach Carpentries workshops, people need to certify as an Instructor. Once you certify, you can 
  teach any Carpentries workshop.</p>
  
 </p> There are two steps to becoming an instructor:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Take the <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training course</a></b>:
      This course runs over two full days and covers the basics of
      educational psychology, instructional design, and how to apply both
      to teaching Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Complete the Software Carpentry checkout process</b>:
      You must complete
      <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/">three short tasks</a>
      after the course in order to complete certification.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
