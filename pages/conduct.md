# Our Community's Code of Conduct

The Carpentries is a community-led project.
We value the involvement of everyone in this community - learners, instructors, hosts, developers, executive council members and staff. 
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, 
teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect 
and courtesy to others.  
 
To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Carpentry activities 
is required to conform to our [Code of Conduct](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by
The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, online forums and 
on GitHub. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with [enforcement](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#enforcement-manual) of the Code of Conduct. See the [reporting guidelines](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#reporting-guidelines).
