                     <p>All Carpentries Workshops are run by a team. Ideally this will consist of a host (who is the principal local
                                        contact for the workshop), certified instructors (who present the material and
                                        lead the practical exercises), a lead instructor (who ensures the teaching aspects
                                        of the workshop go smoothly), and helpers (who provide assistance during practical sessions).
