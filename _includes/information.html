                    <p>Find links to all the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/">current lessons</a> we teach at workshops, including community contributed lessons.</p>
                    <p>Information on attribution, and on how to contribute to lessons, is also held here.</p>
                    
                    <p> Workshops are run by a team. Ideally this will consist of a host (who is the principal local 
                                        contact for the workshop), certified instructors (who present the material and 
                                        lead the practical exercises), a lead instructor (who ensures the teaching aspects 
                                        of the workshop go smoothly), and helpers (who provide assistance during practical sessions). <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/checklists/">See our checklists.</a></p>
