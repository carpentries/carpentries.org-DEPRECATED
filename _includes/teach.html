                    <p class="text-muted">Both Software and Data Carpentry workshops are taught worldwide by <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/team/">certified instructors</a>, all of whom have 
                        completed this two-day <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">training course</a>. All Instructors 
                        are volunteers.</p>
                        
                    <p class="text-muted">Certifying as an Instructor is a useful addition to a CV. Instructors can expect to develop <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-instructors.md">these skills</a>. 
                       <p class="text-muted"> We have a body of Trainers (currently about 44) who teach these workshops so that we can grow our 
                        instructor pool, and take Carpentries workshops to new countries and communities. Trainers are also volunteers, and they will generally develop <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-trainers.md">these skills</a>.</p>
                        
                     <p class="text-muted">   Training is generally run on behalf of <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/membership/">member organizations</a> who leverage their investment in
                    the Carpentries to grow their internal training capacity. Some open trainings are offered each year.</p>
                        
                    <p class="text-muted">New Instructors can gain useful teaching insights by attending < href="http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion">Instructor discussion</a> sessions, run by more experienced Instructors, both before and after workshops. These sessions are helpful to Instructors about to teach for the first time.</p>
